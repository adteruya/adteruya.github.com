                    Overfishing and increased demand for aquatic resources has led to the decimation of species and ecosystems. 
                    <br><br>
                    An example of this would be the Newfoundland Grand Banks fisheries. Advancements in fishing tech allowed for huge catches to be made year after year. However, the toll of such practices began to show in the 1990s, so much so that the cod population of the area has not improved since.
                    <br><br>
                    Currently, the bluefin tuna is facing similar circumstances to that of the Grand Banks. Efforts have been made by some fisherman towards a more sustainable catching process, but it is not universally practiced. Thus, the process of consumption remains unchecked.

                    Forests are a key resources for multiple different fields and aspects of life. As a result, deforestation efforts are one such act that plays into the tragedy of the commons.
                    <br><br>
                    A very recent example is the 2019 Amazon rainforest fires. In this case, the current government of Brazil has been steadily increasing the deforestation efforts that were previously on the decline. There has been a 54% increase in forest fires ever since Brazilâ€™s current leader, Jair Bolsanaro, came to power.
                    <br><br>
                    Similar issues are currently in play in the United States: as of April 2019, President Donald Trump laid out plans to open up national parks to oil fracking. While currently not implemented, such an act is worrisome.

                    Urban cities are, themselves, a direct result of the tragedy of the commons. While the development of cities were, of course, necessary for growing populations, certain mainstays in city life have been detrimental to both the land and the atmosphere.
                    <br><br>
                    Everyday transportation is one example of urban tragedy. The most accessible form of transportation is some form of automized vehicle (cars, motorcycles, etc.); the result of such high usage of these vehicles is the rising CO2 emissions and warming atmosphere. 
                    <br><br>
                    This is textbook tragedy of the commons, since individuals are destroying a public resource (the atmosphere) simply out of everyday decision making.

                <p>
                    It is a phrase commonly used to describe the overuse and exhaustion of shared resources. Individuals (and nations) act out of their own self-interest in the usage of these resources, consequently moving against the collective good of all users.
