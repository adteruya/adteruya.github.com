                    The topics of environment and climate change are both broad and closely linked. Focus on the topics can range from awareness to action, with the potential for even more specificity within the subcategories. For my research, I focused on three different informational pieces with differing perspectives: the public in reaction to corporate environmental practices, the call for collective action and the potential for standard corporate sustainable practices.
                    <br><br>
                    Yossi Steffi, a writer for the Guardian, wrote the article “Profit v planet: can big business and the environment get along?”, which focused mainly on public backlash in response to unveiled corporate production practices. The piece writes about companies like Nestle, who’s palm oil sourcing ended up being the source of debate and retaliation via the public. However, the piece brings up an interesting point about the divide between environmentalist priorities versus business priorities: with such a large consumerist society, its a struggle for companies to keep up with the consumer demand of the public while also maintaining the sustainable and ethical policies of environmentalists. With such a gap, how does society create a means for both parties to understand each other and collectively reciprocate change?
                    <br><br>
                    Keith Weed’s TED Talk “The power of transformative collaboration” provided a potential solution/perspective towards corporate sustainability. Weed’s perspective was one of an insider, so the focus was much more on the methods of practice in which companies can take to fully integrate sustainability into the corporate model. An important focus of the talk was the emphasis on business to not make sustainability an “add on”, but to have the practice ingrained in every process. This includes every separate aspect of the company AND the lifetime usage of the products created. Weed advocates for the collaboration of different fields within companies in order to achieve such a model. An important question raised, however, is the  large span implementation of such a principle: how willing will existing companies accommodate for this change?
                    <br><br>
                    Moving away from corporations, my last piece of research is the TED Talk by climate activist Greta Thunberg. Her talk, “The disarming case to act right now on climate change”, is aimed at society as a whole; for a public that consistently speaks about the dangers of emissions on the Earth, not much is actually done to combat it. People do not see/know about the consequences of everyday consumption/emissions, focusing more on the present than the future. Her call for action is valid, raising the following question: how does one get people to take the time out of their lives to act, and how do we respectively enforce such environmental reciprocity?
                    <br><br>
                    All three pieces made me think about the importance of reciprocity not only between society and the environment, but between the public and corporations as well. It is a cycle in which each party affects the other, each one holding the other accountable for their respective actions. With such gaps in modern life, social media and digital mediums can go a long way in potentially bridging the divide.
