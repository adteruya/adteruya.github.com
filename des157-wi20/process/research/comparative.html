                            <a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/">The World Wildlife Foundation</a> website primarily focuses on educational articles and volunteer programs regarding animals and the effects of global warming. To do so, it places great emphasis bright and vibrant images. These images function both for backgrounds and links, giving the user a relative idea about what the article/service/page is about. There is limited text on the main navigation pages (home pages and sub-pages), with the sentences functioning mainly as attention grabbers for the content they link to. Combined, the natural imagery and brief headlines are effective in catching the attention of browsers without outright providing the main points.
                            <br><br>
                            In regards to navigation, the various links and drop down menus are useful in directing the user to their intended content. However, backtracking is not as obvious, and requires the usage of the built in browser button. While button orientation on the site is as expected for most web pages, there are some button positions that are odd in relation to the flow of the interface. The user can also utilize the search bars and input to navigate to the desired content; but aside from navigation, there is a little usage of user input.
                            <br><br>
                            The user interface of the page is largely contained in the home page: mousing over links provides an interesting animation and photos expand within their tiled format to indicate interactivity. However, not all links have an obvious animation to indicate interactivity, which is something that the overall page could greatly benefit from. On the other hand, the site has a clever progress gauge that keeps track of the distance between the user’s current position and the end of page. The site is quite well-developed, but if it had consistently implemented the homepage’s user interface functions throughout, it would’ve provided a more enjoyable browser experience.

                        <div>

                            <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.org/">The National Geographic website</a> is filled with research and educationally focused content. Like other environment-focused sites, there is a large emphasis on photos, videos and animations. In particular, the animations and videos are significantly more engaging since they force the attention of the user, potentially drawing them into the topic. Minimal text is utilized on the home page and the sub-pages for content; a good limitation for drawing users into the site. Content is mostly displayed in the format of boxes, with the most relevant and recent information being prioritized with bigger containers and higher precedence on pages.
                            <br><br>
                            Navigation on this website shares similar pros and cons with <a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/">the WWF site</a>: drop down menus and big links (in the form of images) guide the reader to the desired content, but lacks a good backtracking system. On the other hand, the input methods for browsing the site include check boxes. This addition is useful in both grouping and narrowing down one’s search content, while minimizing the frustrations that usually come with text input (i.e. failure to find searched content).
                            <br><br>
                            <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.org/">The National Geographic website</a> excels in user interface implementation. Unlike <a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/">the World Wildlife Foundation site</a>, there is a consistent usage of JavaScript as indicators for links present on all site pages. Because of the consistency, simply mousing over images and/or text gives an immediate effect that provides the user with a sense of direction. The indicator links, in combination with the navigation system, provide a smoother browser experience. While both pages use a more minimal layout style, the National Geographic one has better organization when it comes to the positioning of links and buttons. There is a clear and intentional positioning of elements that logically dictates the flow of interaction, or a pattern in which a user might follow.
